            Welcome to our research group webpage. Recent technological advancements in the internet, biology, basic
            sciences,
            engineering, and finance have produced large and complex data sets. By using techniques from optimization,
            signal
            processing, high-dimensional statistics, graph theory, and machine learning, we develop data-driven methods
            to solve
            optimization and learning problems arising from these new technologies. More specifically our impetus is on
            graph
            machine learning theory and applications, optimization theory, federated learning, wireless, networks, and
            machine
            learning for computational neuroscience, medicine, and earth sciences. Broadly, our current research
            projects can be
            grouped under the following partially overlapping themes:

                <h2>Graph Learning</h2>
                <p>Graphical models play a viable role in representing complex data in the fields of science and
                    engineering. Social
                    graphs, biological graphs, financial graphs, transportation graphs, sensor graphs and neural graphs
                    are few prominent
                    examples of graph data. When a natural choice of graph is not readily available from the data sets,
                    inferring or
                    learning a graph topology from the data is preferable. MISN is focusing on learning meaningful graph
                    structures derived
                    from artificial and real data sets.</p>

                <h2>Federated Learning</h2>
                <p>The development of distributed learning has resulted from the increasing complexity of machine
                    learning models, as well
                    as the amount of data required to train them. Federated Learning is a new paradigm for improving the
                    algorithms that now
                    regulate many areas of our lives, such as Facebook's News Feed and Google Maps. By combining
                    knowledge from several data
                    sources, federated learning has the potential to build extremely accurate statistical models.</p>

                <h2>Graph Coarsening</h2>
                <p>Graph coarsening is a widely used dimensionality reduction technique for approaching large-scale
                    graph machine learning
                    problems. Given a graph, graph coarsening aims to learn a smaller-tractable graph while
                    preserving the properties
                    of the originally given graph. Graph coarsening is a relatively new approach, and we are developing
                    graph coarsening
                    algorithms depending on applications such as machine learning, big data etc.</p>

                <h2>Manifold</h2>
                <p>Optimization on manifold has been widely used in machine learning, to handle optimization problems
                    with constraint.
                    Applications appear in various areas, including computer vision, machine learning, maximum
                    likelihood estimation,
                    electronic structure computation, system balancing, model reduction, and robot manipulation. In MISN
                    Lab we are focusing
                    on solving problems like Positivity constraint Manifold optimization problem and many more.</p>

                <h2>Gravity Anamoly Analysis</h2>
                <p>Gravity anomalies are the differences between the observed acceleration of Earth’s gravity and the
                    values predicted from
                    some model of how the gravity would be predicted to appear. The gravity anomaly data is very helpful
                    to many real life
                    applications like mineral extraction, oil extraction, cavity detection and many more. We are working
                    on the application
                    of machine learning techniques to the geophysical data to characterize the subsurface property of
                    the earth.</p>

                <h2>Machine Learning in Wireless Communication</h2>
                <p>AI is one of the key technology players in the digital transformation of the wireless Rf devices.
                    Various machine
                    learning techniques and deep neural networks help in mimicing the behavioural model of the rf
                    devices and help reduce
                    the errors thus enhance the performance of the systems. Applications include Cognitive radio for
                    channel occupancy,
                    sigma Delta modulators for noise shaping and many more.</p>

                <h2>Geometry Aware Semi-supervised Learning</h2>
                <p>Despite vast data that is being generated in various applications, reliably labeled data is
                    relatively scarce due to
                    high cost. In order to incorporate geometry of the data, Graph based Semi-Supervised Learning has
                    achieved great
                    attention to solve modern contemporary problems due to its effectiveness in practice and
                    scalability. It is widely used
                    in many real-world unstructured data dominated applications.</p>

                <h2>Neurocomputing</h2>
                <p>Graph theory has been around for centuries and has touched several fields as a tool to analyze
                    various complex systems.
                    One such highly complex system is our human brain; hence, graph theory is being used to study the
                    human brain
                    ubiquitously. We are working on a few projects to unfold the mysteries of the human brain using
                    state-of-the-art graph
                    models.</p>

                <h2>Climate Science</h2>
                <p>Graph-based machine learning techniques are being increasingly utilized in climate science to uncover
                    complex
                    relationships and patterns within the climate system. By representing climate data as graphs,
                    researchers can gain
                    insights into the organization and dynamics of climate systems. Graph neural networks are employed
                    to model
                    spatio-temporal dependencies, recognize climate patterns, and improve predictions of climate
                    phenomena.</p>
